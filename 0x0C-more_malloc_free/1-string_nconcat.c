/**
 * string_nconcat - function that concatenates two strings
 *
 * Description: The returned pointer shall point to a newly allocated space
 * in memory, which contains s1, followed by
 * the first n bytes of s2, and null terminated
 * If the function fails, it should return NULL
 * If n is greater or equal to the length of s2 then use the entire string s2
 * If NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string
 *
 * @s1: first string to be concatenated
 * @s2: second string to be concatenated
 * @n: number of bytes of s2 to be added
 *
 * Return: pointer to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the
 * contents of s1, followed by the contents of s2, and null terminated
 * NULL is returned on failure
 *
